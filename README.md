# Face-recognition

We intend to perform face recognition, which means that for a given image you can tell the subject id. 
Our database of subjects is very simple. It has 10 images per 40 subjects, and every image is a grayscale image of size 92x112.

The classification will be done using PCA implemented from pseudo-code.
